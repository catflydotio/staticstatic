        <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>It's been a while since I've written anything publicly on my own account. This is not purely because I've been busy, and neither is it that I haven't had any ideas. A lack of Earth-moving things to say hasn't stopped me blogggging or tweeting in the past.</p>

            <p>No, the reason is far more embarrassing. It's a sense that the places I'd set up for myself to post in the past feel untended and ill-fitting now. Penny-wise and pound-foolish, instead of cleaning up what I have, I'm leaving that chore for later and starting to mess up another blank slate.</p>

            <p>I know that if I spend a weekend afternoon updating Hugo, perhaps tweaking CSS, I'll be warmed up again, and possibly I'll let my small thoughts sprout into posts and once in awhile I'll write something that won't bore or embarrass me to tears.</p> 

            <p>What's this, then? It's me setting out on a quest to disperse the haze obscuring the answer to the question "what is it you're really trying to do here?" I'll probably get bored or distracted and abandon the effort, or at least this branch of the effort. But I'll learn something (possibly useless) and/or enjoy myself at a least a little before that happens.</p>

            <p>I'm not committing myself to publishing this anywhere. Entries may get retrospective edits before, or after, publication.</p>

            <p><em>What's</em> this, then? Oh, uh, so far it's a hand-coded HTML "blog" with an index page. Roughing it to try to winnow a clear purpose, rather than scrambling around ineffectually at the surface of shiny but over-powered tool.</p>

            <h3>Thoughts and TIL</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>According to W3, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements should have <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> headings to structure the document. MDN suggests hiding the <code>&lt;h</code>&#120003;<code>&gt;</code> in a far-offscreen location if we don't want to see it. This in itself is a reminder that <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s are generic and we should use something more specific if we can.</li>
                <li>I already miss Markdown and <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/static/WikiText.html">TiddlyWiki-flavoured WikiText</a>.</li>
                <li>Python has a built-in dev server for static files. I don't know why, but that's good news for me. No setup to do today!</li>
